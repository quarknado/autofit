    Reads a file given a handle. The types of files that it reads are 2 column data - histograms with slightly weird binning so you can't just use 1 column and then 1,2,3,4, etc for the bin data.
    I've done it so it can read things that are comma separated and space separated. Again it's a bit weird because it's specific to things created with a 'dump' function that I have for converting
    ROOT histograms to comma separated text files, and a function in RadWare (https://radware.phy.ornl.gov/) (https://web.archive.org/web/20180612114401/https://radware.phy.ornl.gov/) which converts from 
    .spe files used in RadWare to ascii .asc text files. Thus, this function might need to be tweaked if not being used for these specific formats.
